### Schedule

For this training week there is **no fixed schedule**, instead we provide a set of modules for you to choose from.
- This week **YOU make the schedule**, YOU decide which tutorials to follow. YOU decide when to start, stop, and take breaks.
- **New to Galaxy?** We suggest you start with the *"Introduction to Galaxy"* module, followed by the *"Inroduction to NGS Analysis"* module.
- **Unsure which tutorial to follow?** Feel free to ask us for recommendations in Slack!
